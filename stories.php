                                      The days after the birth were a disaster, visitors calling, telephone ringing and neighbours popping in to welcome the new arrival. Friends were so good at offering to help, but I was too proud to let anyone help me. I was now a mother and responsible for another life. I told myself I should be able to cope, however I still worried, rushed around cleaning, washing and fretting over my baby. With the result that as the days went by instead of feeling better, I was feeling worse. I could not rest even when my baby was sleeping, nor could I relax as my mind could not rest. I was scared, not sleeping and felt alone but most of all I felt a failure. I could not wait for Jim to get home from work but when he did, I often snapped his head off and got worked up over the slightest thing. What was happening to me? Was I going mad? I was afraid to ask if all mothers go through this panic.</i>

                                      I should have felt wonderful but instead on the third day I felt miserable, tearful, upset and unable to sleep. My baby was jaundiced and not feeding properly. Everybody was telling me what to do but I feel useless, unable to cope and had no appetite. I felt disappointed in myself and did not want my family and friends to know what a failure I thought I was. I needed someone to talk to for advice and help, but I did not have the courage to ask.</i>

                                       I got pregnant and I was not ready. Nine months later, following a very hard birth, my baby arrived and I did not know what to do. I felt totally miserable, but I did not want anybody to know. After coming home I fell into a routine. The baby was fed and clean, but somewhere in this I was lost. I wanted somebody to tell me what was wrong with me but at the same time how could I tell anybody that I couldn\'t cope. Why did I not want this baby? I continued to feel this way for months. My partner knew that something was wrong, but didn\'t know what to do and so I felt totally alone.</i>

                                      We waited a long time for our baby so she was very precious to us. I could not wait for them to come home so that we could be one big happy family. For a while after the birth my wife was in great form though very tired. Parents and friends were a great help and everything seemed to be great.<br><br>
                                      As time passed things seemed to change. The baby was not sleeping well and keeping us up all night. This wore us down. My wife gradually became very down in herself and got upset over very silly things. Before the birth she was full of life and always laughing. I did not know what was happening. I dreaded coming home every evening to find her sitting at the table crying.<br><br>
                                      I tried to take time off work to help but as I was self-employed I did not get paid if I did not work. It was becoming difficult to cope, trying to make ends meet and worrying about my wife and new baby. I wondered what was happening to us. It was not something men talked about with their pals. I did not know who or where to turn for help. How could I get my wife to accept help when she would not even talk to me.</i>
